title: Working on a 2D SFML C++ Game Part 1.
---



building a c++ platformer game

- no previous experience
- just to learn programming
- no deep conception, more like see what we can do and try to do it

- choosing technology:
 	- avoid full game engines
 	- use something related to c++
 	- why not opengl
 	- sfml, sdl, raylib

Gyaszmat premise:
 - Platformer with satisfying movement and effects
 - Rogue like design (?)
 - Buff system which imrpoves characther attributes, maybe with expiration ( triple jump, faster movement, faster shooting etc.)
 - NPC dialogues
