# Extensions I actually use
## bitwarden - password manager of choice
## ublock origin - best all around content and ad blocker on the market
## dark reader - for night, to dont kil lmy eyes 
## clickbait remover for youtbube - great extension to remove the clickbaity thumbnails from youtube to a random frame from the video
## blocktube - hide channels that i dont want to see even in the search results
## clearurls - remove trackers from urls
## df youtube - hide youtube recommendations to prevent time wastring
## donta ccest image / webp - sometimes firefox loads a webp image instead of a regular image file. this extension changes that behavoir. 
## firefox multi-account containers - lets you create different tabs in different containers which are sepreated. uses one for work, work related profiles are logged in a container
## google images restored - i prefer the old UI of google image search, this restores the old behaviour
## greasemonkey - run any custom script in broser
## honey - sometimes those coupons come handy
## i dont care about cookies - get rid of annoying popups for cookies, it automatically accepets them
## medium unlimited - unlocks medium articles that are blocked after time is consumed
## old reddit redirect - i use old reddit, this extension ensures to always use the old interface instead the new one
## onelogin for firefox - work related
## open image in new tab - add option to context menu to open image in a new tab (i use it all the time)
## qr code - add a button to the url bar to create a qr code from the address
## quick image search - add search to image on google on right click contect menu
## reddit enchancement suite - better reddit experience on desktop with a lot of additional features
## redirector - automatically redirect some sites. use it for an olda page that address has changed, but the old address is in my muscle memmory
## return youtube dislike - returns the ability to see dislikes in youtube (tho not entirely accurate)
## search by image - other image search option, more platforms and it actually uploads the picture to google search not searching for the url (important if the url is not public), i still keep the orther version around cause its 1 less click and works 99% of the time
## sponsorblock - automatically skips sponsors / intros / outros, any uninteresting part of a video
## stylus - custom theme for sites. i use it for some dark themes, where dark reader performance is bad
## teams phone fix - change user agent to age in teams to edge. otherwise you cant make calls from browser
