title: Synthetic Dataset Generation for Custom 3D Object Using Blender
---

# Overview
During my thesis work I faced the problem of how purely documented is the subject of synthetically generated learning datasets for custom 3D objects. You might work in a simulation environment where pretrained neural networks won't work as precise as you expect or you just can't find any public dataset for the object you want to detect. I hope this can help you.

My project is inspired **heavily** from [this](https://olestourko.github.io/2018/02/03/generating-convnet-training-data-with-blender-1.html) post from Oles Tourko about ConvNet training data with Blender. I used it for Darknet YOLO training.
