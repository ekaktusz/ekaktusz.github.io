title: Play Warcraft 3 Frozen Throne Multiplayer With Your Friends | Guide
---

Warcraft 3 Reforged turned out to be peepeepoopoo and playing the old version is a huge pain in the butt, and after the long suffering I've been through I've decided to show you how to play with your friends with the old version. 

**I assume that the game is already installed on your PC.** 

Maybe you read that you need additional tool like Lancraft. **You don't.** If you complete these steps you are ready to play with your friends.

## 1. Download and install Hamachi / Zero Tier && Set Interface Metric
Just follow the steps in this video:

## 2. Add exception to firewall
You're almost ready, but you have to add a firewall exception to the Warcraft 3 and Frozen Throne exe. You can achieve this by doing similar steps to [this](https://www.dummies.com/computers/pcs/computer-security/how-to-allow-firewall-exceptions-on-your-windows-10-laptop/) tutorial. Without this, you can see each other games in LAN menu, but you won't be able to connect and get a time out.

## 3. Play
Now you can enjoy the game. Yay!

PS: If you still have issues, check the port in the gameplay settings. Should be set to the same, like 6112.
