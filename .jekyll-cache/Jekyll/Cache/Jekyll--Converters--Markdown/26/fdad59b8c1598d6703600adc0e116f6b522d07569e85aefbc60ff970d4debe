<p>During my thesis work I faced the problem of how purely documented is the subject of synthetically generated learning datasets for custom 3D objects. You might work in a simulation environment where pretrained neural networks wonâ€™t work as precise as you expect or you just canâ€™t find any public dataset for the object you want to detect. I hope this can help you.</p>
