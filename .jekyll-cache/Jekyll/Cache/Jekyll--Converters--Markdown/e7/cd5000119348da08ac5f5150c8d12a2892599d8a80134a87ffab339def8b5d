<p>During my thesis work I faced the problem for how purely documented is the subject of synthetically generated learning datasets for custom 3D objects. And it can happen pretty easily, that you work in a simulation environment, where pretrained neural networks won’t work as precise as you expect or you just can’t find any public dataset for the object you want to detect. I hope this can help you.</p>

<p>My project is inspired <strong>heavily</strong> from <a href="https://olestourko.github.io/2018/02/03/generating-convnet-training-data-with-blender-1.html">this</a> post from Oles Tourko about ConvNet training data with Blender. I used it for Darknet YOLO training.</p>
