I"R<p>During my thesis work I faced the problem for how purely documented is the subject of synthetically generated learning datasets for custom 3D objects. And it can happen pretty easily, that you work in a simulation environment, where pretrained neural networks won’t work as precise as you expect or you just can’t find any public dataset for the object you want to detect. 
I want to clarify that my method is just a base to help you think how to solve your problem and specifically designed for my personal needs. It pobably won’t work great without minor or major modifications.</p>
