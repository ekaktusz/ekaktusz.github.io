I"š<p>During my thesis work I faced the problem for how purely documented is the subject of synthetically generated learning datasets for custom 3D objects. And it can happen pretty easily, that you work in a simulation environment, where pretrained neural networks wonâ€™t work as precise as you expect or you just canâ€™t find any public dataset for the object you want to detect. I hope this can help you.</p>
