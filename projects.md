Also for a complete list of games I've worked on is available on itch.io [here](https://ekaktusz.itch.io/).

This small puzzle game with multiple levels and mechanics that was created as a submission for Github Game Off 2022 in PICO-8 and Lua. This was my first game jam. We finished on 4th place overall. I did the coding alone in approximately 10 days, and designed the website.
