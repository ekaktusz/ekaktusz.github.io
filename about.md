I'm Csaba Ekart, Software Engineer from Budapest, experienced with C++, Python, Java and Linux (I'm also a huge Lua fan). I'm highly interested in Neural Networks, Computer Vision, Computer Graphics and Video Game Development.

⌨️ I really like mechanical keyboards and capybaras. 

This is my personal page, where I share posts that I think could be useful for others, and projects I'm working on. You can reach me on email / Linkedin or any other platform which are linked at the bottom of the page.
I hope you find what you looking for! Have a wonderful day! ☀️
