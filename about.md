I'm Csaba Ekart, software engineer from Budapest, experienced with Java, C++ and Python. I'm highly interested in neural networks, computer vision, 3D graphics, Android development, computer security and privacy.

This is my personal page, where I share posts that I think could be useful for others, and projects I'm working on.
