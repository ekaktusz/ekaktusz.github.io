I'm Csaba Ekart, Software Engineer from Budapest, experienced with C++, Python, Java and Linux. I'm highly interested in Neural Networks, Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, Android Development, Computer Security and Privacy.

This is my personal page, where I share posts that I think could be useful for others, and projects I'm working on.
